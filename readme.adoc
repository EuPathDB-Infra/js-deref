Recursively resolves `"$ref"` properties and appends the
external schema content to the root `"definitions"` object.

Reads entire directory trees and copies the input files to
the output location.

WARNING: This utility is not presently suited for general
use as a json schema ref resolver.  It is tailored to the
specific case of absolute filesystem path references to the
root of a java project's resource directory.

== Usage

[source, bash session]
----
$ js-deref <input_dir> <output_dir>
